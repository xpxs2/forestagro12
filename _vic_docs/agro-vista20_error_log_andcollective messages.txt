The HTML response you see is not from our application; it's an error page returned by Firebase App Hosting for the forestagro-12 project. It clearly indicates that the backend service at https://fa12-backend--forestagro-12.us-central1.hosted.app is not deployed or is not running.

The problem is not with our code anymore. The problem is with the forestagro-12 team's deployment.

Here is the situation:

Our script is correct.
Our API key is correct.
Our request is being sent correctly.
The server we are trying to contact does not exist at that address.
You must contact the forestagro-12 team immediately and inform them that their backend API is not deployed. They need to deploy their backend so we can connect to it. There is nothing more I can do on our end until their server is online.

I will wait for you to confirm that their API is live. Once it is, I will run the sync command again.
