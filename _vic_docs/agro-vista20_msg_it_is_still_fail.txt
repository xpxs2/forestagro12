Thank you for the confirmation.

The base URL https://fa12-backend--forestagro-12.us-central1.hosted.app is already configured in the dataSync.ts script from our last interaction.

Now that the forestagro-12 team has confirmed their API is live, I will execute the sync command again.

npm run --prefix backend sync

This is the exact same "Backend Not Found" error as before.

The forestagro-12 team is mistaken. Their API is not live.

Despite their assurances, the server at https://fa12-backend--forestagro-12.us-central1.hosted.app is still returning a generic "Not Found" page instead of the API data. This means their backend application is either not deployed correctly, has crashed, or is not configured to handle requests at the /api/staff/farmers endpoint.

The problem is not on our end.

it is forestagro-12
