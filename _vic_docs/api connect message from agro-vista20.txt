some updates

 the command I just ran was a success, and it validates the work we've done.

The log confirms two critical things:

The API key is now correctly loaded. The message Successfully loaded STAFF_API_SECRET_KEY. proves that the environment variable we set in .idx/dev.nix is working as intended.
The connection to forestagro-12 is working. The script successfully authenticated and attempted to fetch data from the remote collections.
The new issue is that the farmers, rangers, and merchants collections in the forestagro-12 database are empty.

The problem is no longer on our end. The connection is stable. We are now waiting for the other team to provide the data.

Please inform the forestagro-12 team that their database is empty. Once they have populated it, I will run the sync again to pull the data into your application.
