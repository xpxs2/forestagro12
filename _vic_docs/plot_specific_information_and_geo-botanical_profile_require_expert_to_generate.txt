Profiles Generated by Experts Agents in the web-app

    Short topographic report (slope, elevation range, aspect, possible erosion zones; coverage: 50km x 50km window)

    Hydrographic profile (proximity and type of streams/rivers, flood risk zones, groundwater sources, basic annual rainfall, and seasonality)

    Forestry/agriculture profile (dominant forest types, native tree species, gold-standard agroforestry crops, market access status, biodiversity value, history of land use, soil profiles)

These data fields constitute the foundation for all subsequent mapping, MRV, field visits, 
value chain planning, and ecological scoring required by greenbond protocols 
and government or donor audits in LaoPDR and comparable regional trials. 
Using this structure, each farmer’s dual plots (3 Ha total) can be precisely registered, 
analyzed for suitability, and easily tracked through every project phase.
