# Agro-Ecological Context: Sample Data Scenarios

This document provides anticipated data lists for two distinct farmer personas to guide the development of a flexible and localized web application.

---

### **Scenario 1: Commercial Agroforestry**

- **Farmer ID:** `farmth01`
- **Location:** Surat Thani Province, Thailand (near Ratchaprapa Dam)
- **Agro-Ecological Context:** A classic commercial agroforestry region focused on a mix of long-term income from tree crops and short-term income from intercropping. The primary challenges are managing soil on rolling hills and maximizing yield for established markets.

#### **Anticipated Data Profile:**

**A) Plot & Environmental Data (Ranger/System Input):**
- **Topographic Report:** "Rolling hills with 5-15% slopes, acidic but well-drained Ultisols."
- **Hydrographic Profile:** "High monsoon rainfall with moderate erosion risk into local waterways."
- **Forestry/Agriculture Profile:** "National hub for rubber and high-value fruit production. Strong local markets."

**B) Land Use & Assets (Farmer `farmth01` Input):**
- **Primary Tree Crops:** Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), Durian (Durio zibethinus).
- **Secondary Tree Crops:** Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana).
- **Intercropped Plants:** Pineapple (Ananas comosus) planted between young trees, Chili (Capsicum spp.) in open areas.
- **Livestock:** Small-scale poultry for household use.

**C) Agroforestry Practices (Farmer/Ranger Input):**
- **Land Management:** Contour plowing on slopes, leaving rubber leaf litter as mulch.
- **Input Use:** Applying NPK fertilizers for Durian fruiting; using lime to manage soil pH.
- **Tree Management:** Regular pruning regime for Durian trees to increase fruit yield.

### **Scenario 2: Watershed Rehabilitation & Food Security**

- **Farmer ID:** `farmid01`
- **Location:** Batam, Indonesia (near Muka Kuning Reservoir)
- **Agro-Ecological Context:** An industrial island where agroforestry serves a critical infrastructure protection role. The primary goals are preventing soil erosion into an urban water supply, rehabilitating degraded land, and providing local food security.

#### **Anticipated Data Profile:**

**A) Plot & Environmental Data (Ranger/System Input):**
- **Topographic Report:** "Steep, short slopes (10-25%) with thin topsoil directly bordering a critical reservoir."
- **Hydrographic Profile:** "High risk of siltation and nutrient runoff into the urban water supply."
- **Forestry/Agriculture Profile:** "Focus is watershed rehabilitation. Crops must have strong soil-binding properties. Commercial export crops are not a priority."

**B) Land Use & Assets (Farmer `farmid01` Input):**
- **Primary Soil-Binding Crops:** Banana (Musa spp.), Cassava (Manihot esculenta).
- **Secondary Soil-Binding Crops:** Pineapple (Ananas comosus) for groundcover.
- **Nitrogen-Fixing/Cover Crops:** Soybean (Glycine max) planted to improve soil fertility.
- **Fast-Growing Food Crops:** Papaya (Carica papaya) for local market sales.

**C) Agroforestry Practices (Farmer/Ranger Input):**
- **Land Management:** Mandatory terracing on all slopes, heavy mulching to protect the soil surface.
- **Input Use:** Strictly organic amendments (compost, manure) to prevent chemical runoff into the reservoir.
- **Regeneration:** Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) is a key activity, promoted by rangers.

### **Appendix: General Notes on Data Collection Philosophy**

1.  **Principle of Localization:** The application must reject a "one-size-fits-all" model. The crop droplists, practice recommendations, and environmental data must be specific to the farmer's registered location. The data for Batam is fundamentally different from the data for Surat Thani.

2.  **Data for Action:** Data collection is not for archival purposes. Every piece of information a farmer enters should be used to provide immediate value, such as populating the "at-a-glance" dashboard, triggering alerts, or unlocking new features like market access.

3.  **Progressive Disclosure:** Farmers should not be faced with a hundred-field form upon registration. The app should guide them through a step-by-step process. First, register your plot. Next, add your main trees. Then, add your intercrops. Later, record your practices. This builds a complete profile over time without causing user fatigue.

4.  **Connecting Data to Value (The Core Loop):** The central premise of this application is a virtuous cycle:
    - A farmer records their **Land Use** (e.g., 500 Durian trees).
    - They document their sustainable **Practices** (e.g., using organic compost).
    - A Ranger **Verifies** this data, increasing its trustworthiness.
    - This trusted data unlocks **FinTech** opportunities (e.g., a micro-loan based on the future harvest value of the verified trees) and **Market** access (e.g., a buyer looking for certified organic Durian).
    - The financial benefit incentivizes the farmer to record more accurate data, completing the loop.
