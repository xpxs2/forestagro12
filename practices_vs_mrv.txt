# Practices vs. MRV: A Clear Separation of Work

**Purpose:** To define the clear and absolute separation between the farmer's work (Practices & Management) and the system's work (MRV - The Proof). This document supersedes all previous discussions that conflated the two.

---

### **Part 1: The Farmer's Domain: Practices & Management**

**This is what YOU do. This is your work, your knowledge, your land.**

Your responsibility is to manage your farm and to log those actions as simply as possible. The system should work for you, not the other way around.

Your work falls into clear categories:

1.  **Soil Management:**
    *   Logging the use of compost or manure.
    *   Planting cover crops (e.g., legumes).
    *   Practicing low-tillage techniques.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   Maintaining or building irrigation channels.
    *   Harvesting rainwater.
    *   Installing drip irrigation systems.

3.  **Crop, Tree & Asset Management:**
    *   Planting new trees (timber, fruit, medicinal).
    *   Intercropping different species.
    *   Pruning, thinning, or harvesting existing assets.

4.  **Input Management:**
    *   Recording the type and amount of any fertilizer used (organic or chemical).
    *   Recording the use of any pesticides.

**The Goal of Your Work:** To manage a productive and sustainable farm. The platform's job is to make logging these activities as fast and painless as possible, like a digital logbook for your own records.

### **Part 2: The System's Domain: MRV (The Proof)**

**This is what WE do. This is our job, our responsibility.**

Our responsibility is to take the simple data you provide and turn it into powerful, verifiable proof of impact. This is the exclusive job of a dedicated **"MRV Agent."** You should not have to think about this part.

1.  **M = Measurement (Calculation):**
    *   The MRV Agent takes your input (e.g., "planted 100 Grevillea trees") and combines it with scientific models.
    *   It **calculates** the estimated carbon sequestration, the improvement in soil organic matter, or the change in water efficiency. You don't do the complex math.

2.  **R = Reporting (Packaging):**
    *   The MRV Agent takes these calculated impacts and packages them into professional, standardized reports.
    *   These reports are designed to be understood and trusted by banks, carbon credit buyers, and certification bodies.

3.  **V = Verification (Auditing):**
    *   The MRV Agent structures all the data and calculations in a way that is transparent and auditable.
    *   It ensures that when a third-party verifier wants to check the work, they have a clear, credible data trail to follow, starting from your original logged practice.

**The Goal of Our Work:** To convert your good work into a high-value, bankable asset with zero extra effort from you.

### **The Bridge: The Analyst Agent**

The only place where these two worlds meet is through the **Analyst Agent**, whose job is to be your personal advisor.

*   The Analyst Agent looks at **YOUR practices**.
*   It gives you simple, helpful advice to improve your farm's productivity and sustainability.
*   Crucially, it will also give you tips on the *easiest* way to improve your data quality to make the **MRV Agent's** job more effective, thereby increasing the value of your proof.

**Example:**
*   **You log:** "Used compost on Plot A."
*   **The Analyst Agent advises:** "Great work on soil health. **Opportunity:** If you also log the *amount* of compost used, your MRV Readiness score for soil carbon will increase by 10%."

This maintains the separation. You focus on your work. We focus on proving its value. The Analyst Agent is simply a helpful guide that connects the two worlds without forcing you to live in both.
